This is the readme file for my ACCN project.
First objective: 

- Verify Hay et al. and Larkum et al. neuron models:
    - Backpropagating APs
    - Firing response to current injection
    - Ca2+ spikes
    - Dendritic processing: 
      - One NMDA spike in distal tuft branch can not 
        reach treshold for Ca2+ spike in Ca2+ initiation zone, but two can (Larkum et al. 2009).
      - Small depolarizations near Ca2+ spike initiation zone enables 
      	NMDA spike in single tuft to evoke Ca2+ spikes (Larkum et al. 2009).

Second objective:

- How can effects of cannel blockers,
  - Fast Na+ blocker TTX
  - Calsium blocker Cadmium
  - Calsium blocker Nickel
  - I_h blocker ZD7288
  and receptor blocker:
  - NMDA blocker AP5 
  best be introduced into the computational models.

Third objective:

- Can these effects be seen on any realistic/unrealistic MEA:
  - Backpropagating APs
  - Ca2+ spikes
  - Subtreshold current injection
  - Dendritic processing:
    - NMDA spikes in distal tuft
      - More than one at the time?
    - Depolarizations?
  - Changed channel densities
  - Other changed neuron parameters

Need to find/develop/adjust:
     - Find(/develop) good plotting tools for neural activity (Neuronvisio)
